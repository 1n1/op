     +------------------------------+
     | Initialization and variables |
     +------------------------------+
    
     When you call 'op' without arguments, it sources all operations stored in
     a relative subdirectory from the invocation dir, under ./ops/*
    
     Those sourced operations, can reuse this program variables and functions.
    
     There are switches to call specific ./ops/ files (-o) and specific requests
     under ./requests/ (-r). We will reference those custom files as "recipes"
     from now on.
    
     The modes -e and -u, are set at initialization, recipes will be affected
     by such behavior.
    
     By default we're quiet, with the program output. Use -v to see verbose
     messages.
    
     Use --trial on the command line, for test without applying commands.
    
     By now, only for root can run op. This may change in a future.
    
     The program initializes the following variables, that you can latter
     reuse in your recipes.
    
     * version: The program version.
     * op: contains the executable name, used on messages, etc.
     * work_dir: The directory where the program was invocated.
     * files: The main directory for files used in recipes.
     * rollback_dir: The rollback files main directory.
     * lock: The file used to block against parallel sessions.
     * verbose: The verbosity switch (bool, default disabled, 0).
     * trial: The trial switch (bool, default disabled, 0).
     * nocolor: The colors switch (boold, default disabled, 0).
     * hostname: It contains the hostname at our launch time.
    
     The following foreground color variables, are initialized for reusing:
    
         normal, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
    
    
     The help message, is stored in the variable: op_help
    
     +---------------+
     | Logging files |
     +---------------+
    
     Each run, gets a uniq identifier, stored in the variable: run_id
    
     This is used to manage the symlinks, to the latest log and the latest
     rollback directories.
    
     The variables 'logs' and 'logfile' will point to our current log during
     execution. Mostly for internal use.
    
     +-------------------------+
     | Notifications variables |
     +-------------------------+
    
     Notifications are controlled by the boolean: notify_enabled
    
     Set to 1 to notify run results, set to 0 to disable notifications.
    
     Mail notifications are configured using:
    
     * mail_to: main recipient
     * mail_cc: addresses with a copy
    
     The notify_tpl() funtion, emits the mail body sent.
    
     Edit all of them to your needs if you enable notifications.

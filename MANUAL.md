#  op - *The* operations tool

This program, helps to make systems definitions **reproducible** and to
help on system's maintenance and discovery.

##  Initialization

When you call ```op``` without arguments, it sources all definitions stored
in a relative subdirectory from the invocation dir, under ```./play/*```.

Those sourced operations, can reuse the ```op``` variables and functions.

There are switches to call specific ```./play/``` files (```-p```) and
specific requests under ```./requests/``` with (```-r```). 

By default we're quiet, with the program output. Use ```-v``` to see verbose
messages.

Use ```--trial``` on the command line, for test without applying commands.

The modes ```-e``` and ```-u```, are set at initialization, recipes will be
affected by such behavior, as they are sourced.

##  Program variables

The program initializes the following variables, that you can latter
reuse in your recipes.

* ```version```: The program version.
* ```op```: contains the executable name, used on messages, etc.
* ```work_dir```: The directory where the program was invocated.
* ```files```: The main directory for files used in recipes.
* ```rollback_dir```: The rollback files main directory.
* ```lock```: The file used to block against parallel sessions.
* ```verbose```: The verbosity switch (bool, default disabled, 0).
* ```trial```: The trial switch (bool, default disabled, 0).
* ```nocolor```: The colors switch (bool, default disabled, 0).
* ```hostname```: It contains the hostname at our launch time.
* ```pkgtool```: Package system (apt, yum).


##  Color variables

The following foreground color variables, are initialized for reusing:

    normal, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
###  Logging variables

Each run gets a uniq identifier, stored in the variable: ```run_id```

The variables ```logs``` and ```logfile``` will point to our current
log during execution. For internal use.

###  Notifications variables


Notifications are controlled by the boolean: ```notify_enabled```

Set to 1 to notify run results, set to 0 to disable notifications.

HTTP notifications are configured using:

```http_url```: URL to use for the request
```http_headers```: Extra headers in curl format
```http_options```: All of the previous together

Use ```http_options``` to tune any extra curl option you may need.

Welcome.

We're on development stage, for the good and for the bad.

You can look for FIXME tags around in the code.

Also, there is a TO-DO:

* Allow running with no sudo, will need some modifications.
* Most of the rollback deletions are just info messages. Needs caveats.
* Review permissions(), file() and diretory() to accept UID/GID as well.
* Implement repeatable link(), swap(), mount() and many others...
* Add a --debconf option to pkg()
* Check for non-builtins before run, there is nothing special, but...
* Only tested on linux (and core-utils assumed).

All contributions, including those not listed here, are welcome.
